Medallion Architecture
Source --> Landing --> Staging --> Raw --> ML Models.        (Training Models)
                                       --> Dimension Models. (Curation/Transformations)
                                       --> Visualizations    (Power BI etc)


Design Steps:

1. Create sample data - as per the schema which is needed for predictive maintenance
2. Design folder structure - Blob
    aveva 
        pi
          yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss
            pi.csv
3. Create delta live tables to source data from source folder - landing folder
4. Load - Landing
5. Load - Staging
6. Load - Raw
7. Train ML Model - notebooks
8. Deploy the Model into prod


Topics to learn in Non-Working Sessions ()
1. Unity Catalog - Databricks
2. Delta Live Tables 
3. Auto Loader
4. Python Programming - basics/advanced
5. ML Algorithms
